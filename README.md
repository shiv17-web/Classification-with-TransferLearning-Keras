# Classification-with-TransferLearning-Keras

Created and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an existing CNN model architecture, and its pre-trained weights. Used the MobileNet model architecture along with its weights trained on the popular ImageNet dataset. By using a model with pre-trained weights, and then training just the last layers on a new dataset, the training time required to fit the model to the new data drastically reduced . The pre-trained model has already learned to recognize thousands on simple and complex image features.
